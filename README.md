# flash_cards

A simple CRUD api to manage flash card content, each card will have a topic, question, and an answer to be used as a study aide.

Inspired by https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university

# todo

Expand api/dao ops to include:
	- fetch
	- update
	- remove

Create basic app template and server route
Extend request interfaces at route for "self-documenting" code

Think of some sort of random sort prio. e.g SET last selected
